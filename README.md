Suppose you are the IT professional in charge of security for a small pharmacy that has recently opened within a shopping mall. The daily operation of a pharmacy is a unique business that requires a combination of both physical and logical access controls geared towards protecting medication and funds located on the premises, as well as the personally identifiable information and protected health information of your customers that resides on your system. Your supervisor has tasked you with identifying inherent risks associated with your pharmacy and establishing strong physical and logical access control methods to mitigate the identified risks.

Write an eight to ten (8-10) page paper in which you:

<ol>

 <li>Identify at least five (5) potential physical threats that require attention.</li>

 <li>Determine the impact of at least five (5) potential logical threats that require attention.</li>
